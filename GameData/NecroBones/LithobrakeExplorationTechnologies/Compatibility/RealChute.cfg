		spareChutes = 5 //----------------RealChutes come with Spares! Engineers (configurable) in Career, or everyone in other modes, can repack a "spent" Parachute, using a spare, and it's good as new. Note: RealChutes also get the "Disarm" option, in addition to "Cut" and "Deploy"

			cutAlt = -1 // default altitude the parachute is auto cut at; -1 means ground contact basically. If you have a double chute, you can set it so the first chute gets cut at the same height as the second chute opens for example (RealChute has a chute like this included)
			preDeploymentSpeed = 2 // speed at which chute opens during predeployment; might be useful to tweak if you want to reduce abruptness of opening
