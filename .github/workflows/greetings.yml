          Have you reviewed the open issues logs and recent changelogs?
          
          In order to help us help you, please provide:
          * <KSP_ROOT>/KSP.LOG
          * and one of the following:
            * if Module Manger is installed
              * <KSP_ROOT>/GameData/ModuleManager.ConfigCache
            * if Module Manger /L is installed
              * <KSP_ROOT>/PluginData/ModuleManager/ConfigCache.cfg
          * Screenshots of issue (if appropriate) (images tell a much stronger tale)
          
          You can archive these files (rar or zip, sadly no 7zip) and drag-n-drop them into an issue comment
