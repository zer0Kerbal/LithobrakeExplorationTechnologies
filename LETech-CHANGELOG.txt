0.3 (2015-11-11) - KSP 1.0.5 update.

 - Fixed a scaling error with the "large" octagonal bay's doors, causing it to leave gaps when closed.
 - Radial parachute's storage case reduced in size by 15%.
 - Increased deployed-drag multiplier on all parachutes.
 - Added Connected Living Space support.
 - Added TweakScale support.

0.2 (2015-08-03) - Wide Alpha
